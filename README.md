# tensorflow-go

This is the example code to implement tensorflow's model in Golang. 
I make this package because of the curiosity to know how I can implement tensorflow in Golang.


As you know, majority of data scientists are using Python as a language to make models of machine learning.
But It is difficult for Software Engineer to implement it in the production due to high traffic.
One of the solution is using Golang.


I have also included documentation on how to implement the tensorflow-go
